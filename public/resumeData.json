    "bio": "My name is Hillary Okello. I am a software engineer from Jinja, Uganda. My expertise is in web technologies, and I specialize in Python-Django web framework, Ruby on Rails, React and Redux. I work with frontend technology such as React, Jquery and Bootstrap. I have also worked with Python Django web framework to create websites for my clients while freelancing. I attended Microverse, an online coding school to master every aspect of skills that professional programmers need in their daily lives from the technical skills(Ruby / Ruby on Rails / Javascript / React and Redux / HTML / CSS) to the soft skills(Pair Programming / Remote Working / Team Collaboration / Mentoring). Now, I can comfortably build solutions based on ideas, solve business puzzles and give professional advice with my coding knowledge. I love to help businesses grow with coding so that people can focus on creating beautiful things for society instead of working on repetitive tasks.",
